This project implements several internet security related tools and conceptions in high-level perspective. The scripts are written in Python language.

## Docker Manual
Docker command alias has permission problem comparing to the full command. Container might not build or run, if type `dcbuild` command in terminal, but `docker-compose build` would work.
```
$ docker-compose build  # Build the container image
$ docker-compose up     # Start the container
$ docker-compose down   # Shut down the container
$ docker network ls     # Find out network ID of docker containers
$ docker ps             # List all the running containers in docker
$ dockps        // Alias for: docker ps --format "{{.ID}}  {{.Names}}"
$ docksh <id>   // Alias for: docker exec -it <id> /bin/bash
```
