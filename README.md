# Internet_Security
This project implements several internet security related tools and conceptions in high-level perspective. The scripts are primarily written in Python language.

## Command Tools
`ifconfig` command, check out network interface in the host
`nc -lnv <port>` command, set up netcat TCP listenning application from any host to the port number <port> in this host
## Docker Manual
Docker command alias has permission problem comparing to the full command. Container might not build or run, if type `dcbuild` command in terminal, but `docker-compose build` would work.
```
$ docker-compose build  # Build the container image
$ docker-compose up     # Start the container
$ docker-compose down   # Shut down the container
$ docker network ls     # Find out network ID of docker containers
$ docker ps             # List all the running containers in docker
$ docker rm <name>      # remove the duplicated container name before generating new one
$ dockps        // Alias for: docker ps --format "{{.ID}}  {{.Names}}"
$ docksh <id>   // Alias for: docker exec -it <id> /bin/bash
```

## Notes
Write a function in `~/.bashrc` file, and type `source ~/.bashrc` to activate the function that changes tab name in the Ubunutu terminal. \
`st $TabName`, change the tab name in the default Ubuntu terminal to $TabName

```
alias st=settitle
settitle() {
    TITLE="\[\e]2;$@\a\]"
    PS1=${PS1}${TITLE}
}
```
Other alias set up in SEED image
```
alias ll='ls -l'
PROMPT_DIRTRIM=1
PATH=$PATH:.

# Commands for for docker 
alias dcbuild='docker-compose build'
alias dcup='docker-compose up'
alias dcdown='docker-compose down'
alias dockps='docker ps --format "{{.ID}}  {{.Names}}"'
docksh() { docker exec -it $1 /bin/bash; }
```
